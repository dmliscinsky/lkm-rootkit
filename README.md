# lkm-rootkit
A basic Linux kernel module rootkit.


This project is very much a work in progress.


# Warning
I do not recommend installing the kernel module on any computer you care about in case it causes any damage to that system (for example, permanently being unable to successfully boot the operating system, etc.).

The author does not condone or take any responsibility for any illegitimate/illegal usage of the rootkit or its capabilities. The rootkit is designed purely as a tool for experimentation and learning at the user's own risk.
